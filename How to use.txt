But before following these steps, we do need 3 files which are used to merge the audio and video our resource properly, ping me directly to get those file links which are more than 100mb each and github doesn't allows them to be pushed to remote areas as the file size is too large
After the files, create a virtual environment and use this command inside it install necessary packages for this project : "pip install -r requirements.txt"
Steps to follow after having all the files and required packages downloaded : 

Step - 1 :  Start the Apache service from the XAMPP.
Step - 2 : open the desired folder from the cmd and use this to run the file  : D:\Youtube_Downloader\youtube_downloader>python app.py
		(or else) we can also directly run that file from the vs code editor, or terminal in the same path
Step - 3 : Now copy any youtube video or audio link that you would like to download.
Step - 4 : Now open the website throush any browser whereas presently in "localhost:5000"
Step - 5 : Paste the youtube link and select the desired quality and the file format and click on download.
Step - 6 : Wait until the download finishes and check the file in your downloads folder or any other desired folder .
